# Let's Build a Hook!

To get started, use the `npm install` and `npm run start:lesson-1` to get started. This will start
a Parcel site and display a site on http://localhost:1234.

Each lesson builds on the last, but is a fresh start and will work on it's own. `npm run lesson-x`
will start the given lesson.
